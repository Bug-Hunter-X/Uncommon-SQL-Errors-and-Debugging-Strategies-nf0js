In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column. For example, attempting to store a large integer in a smallint column will result in truncation or an error.  Another issue is neglecting to handle NULL values appropriately.  If a query assumes a column will always have a value, unexpected results can arise when NULLs are encountered.  Furthermore, incorrect JOIN conditions can lead to inaccurate or incomplete results, especially in complex queries.
