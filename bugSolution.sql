To address data type issues, carefully examine the data being stored and select the most appropriate column type. For NULL handling, employ functions like IS NULL or COALESCE to manage potentially missing values.  Review JOIN conditions to ensure accurate data relationships.  Always test queries thoroughly with various input datasets and check results carefully.
